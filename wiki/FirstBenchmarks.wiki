#summary Some benchmarking results; more will be added here as I get them.
=First Benchmarks=
The benchmarks were performed for each implementation ([http://code.google.com/p/ugl-uminho-cpd/wiki/GraphMapSucc MapSucc], [http://code.google.com/p/ugl-uminho-cpd/wiki/GraphMapAdj MapAdj] and [http://code.google.com/p/ugl-uminho-cpd/wiki/GraphArraySucc ArraySucc]) for the following algorithms.

==Benchmarks to add soon...==

 * Test the implementations for several connection density ratio (more or less edges) for the same number of nodes.
 * Test with different weight ranges (a graph with a weight range of [5, 90] may be more efficient than another with [5, 9] since the decisions are made faster).
 * New structure implementations
