#summary Explaining the objectives of the UnionFind control forest

The UnionFind structure is basically a control forest where the forest is composed of _#Node_ trees, each tree has initially only one element - one tree per node. *Its objective is* to provide a way to control the structure of the disjoint set of trees that can be altered while an algorithm executes. 

It provides two useful operations:
 * *Find*: this operation has two variants. The first finds the root element of another given element; *_y_ = find(_x_)*, means _x_ is in the same tree has _y_ and _y_ is its root. The second variant checks if two elements are in the same tree; for the earlier example, *find(_x_, _y_) = _TRUE_*
 * *Union*: combines/merges two sets of trees into the same tree.
